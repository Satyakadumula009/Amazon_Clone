# Amazon Clone Project

## Overview

This project is a basic Amazon clone that simulates the front-end interface of the popular e-commerce platform. It has been created as a learning exercise to understand the fundamentals of web development. Notably, this project does not utilize JavaScript, focusing solely on HTML and CSS for the structure and styling.

## Features

- **Homepage:** A simple landing page with a basic layout that mimics Amazon's homepage.
- **Product Listings:** Static product pages that display items for sale.
- **Product Details:** Individual pages for each product with descriptions and pricing information.
- **Shopping Cart:** A basic layout for a shopping cart (non-functional due to the lack of JavaScript).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** Used for structuring the web pages.
- **CSS:** Used for styling the web pages and creating a responsive design.

## Limitations

- **No JavaScript:** As a result, the website is purely static with no interactivity. Functions like adding items to the cart, user authentication, and dynamic content updates are not present.
- **No Backend:** This project does not include any server-side logic or database integration.

## Future Improvements

- Implementing JavaScript for interactivity, such as a functional shopping cart and dynamic content.
- Adding a backend with a database to manage product data and user accounts.
- Improving the overall design and responsiveness of the website.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to view the homepage.
3. Navigate through the different pages using the provided links.
